# Speakers

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

His talk will be all about what the Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for
the rest of 2016.

#### [Shiya Luo](https://twitter.com/ShiyaLuo)

Shiya Luo is a developer evangelist from Autodesk where she works on getting Web Service APIs that deals with 3D designs connected to third party developers. She has been developing internal tools and services and writing demos and sample code with Node.js.

Shiya will talk about the process and workflows that we've been using to publish Web Service APIs heavily dependent on Node.js. The reasoning that we went through to start using Node.js in writing sample code, generating documentation and bring all RESTful APIs built with different languages together.

#### [Jose Miguel Parrella](https://twitter.com/bureado)

Jose Miguel Parrella is an Open Source Product Manager with the Microsoft Azure team. Heâ€™s had over 15 years of experience in the field of open source ranging from policy and advocacy to consulting and Linux systems integration. He joined Microsoft in 2010 as an open source strategist in Latin America and the Caribbean.

In this talk, we'll explore common architectures and considerations for cloud Node.js deployments based on learnings from customers running Node.js in Microsoft Azure. The session includes a number of demos and discussion on deployment architectures and patterns (for example, VM Scale Sets, containers, PaaS, etc.) and using cloud solutions from Node.js like managed databases or IoT telemetry/data streaming facilities. This is also a great opportunity for participants to learn about the approach to open source developers are taking in the public cloud.

#### [Chau Yee Cheung](https://github.com/joyeecheung)

Monitoring and profiling are two essential components in building reliable large-scale web applications. Technologies commonly used in the enterprise world usually come with various tools for monitoring and profiling applications in production, but Node.js, as the new kid in At AliCloud, having seen plenty of bugs and mistakes lurking in Node.js code, we want to share our experiences in how to track them down in production, and help the community grow out of them.
