#### [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Ashley, npm's Developer Community and Content Manager, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest 
features, old and new, and demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make 
you better, happier, and more productive. Ashley will outline the most commonly used npm tools 
for starting a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and 
managing teams and organization project work. She’ll focus in particular on workflows that 
will help frontend developers, npm’s biggest and fastest-growing group of users.
