# Speakers

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of 
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

His talk will be all about what the Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for 
the rest of 2016.

#### [Justin Meyer](https://twitter.com/justinbmeyer)

Justin Meyer (@justinbmeyer) is the lead author of DoneJS and a core contributor to CanJS 
and StealJS. He’s the CEO of Bitovi, a JavaScript consulting company known for making apps 
for Walmart and other high profile companies he can’t talk about.

His talk shows how the recently released DoneJS framework makes it easy to build fast 
single page applications that are:
* server side rendered
* progressively loaded
* use content delivery networks

You will discover how DoneJS solves these problems while building a simple real-time chat 
application. As a bonus, Justin will show how to build the chat application to a mobile and 
desktop application so all three versions of the app can chat together. If there's time, 
he might even turn on worker thread rendering.

TBD :)
