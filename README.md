# Node.js Live Website

## Contributing

Checkout the git repo and get started:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This fires up a server that reloads/rebuilds on file changes, located at http://localhost:8080.

All content is in markdown. The main page is `index.md` and all the individual event
pages are in `events/`

If you have any questions about the events or the website log an Issue :)
