# Node.js Live Website

## Contributing

Checkout the git repo and get started:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Once you've installed all the deps and run a build all the html assets are built. To test use:

```
npm start
```

The server *should* auto-reload but it's having some problems :(
  
All content is in markdown. The main page is `index.md` and all the individual event 
pages are in `events/`

If you have any questions about the events or the website log an Issue :)

## Interested in Speaking?

If you live or plan to be near one of the Node.js Live events and are interested in 
speaking please log an issue on this repository with your talk, title and description
and don't forget to tell us which event it is for.

Because Node.js Live is an event series for local communities we do not have travel
assistance available :(
